1. Database Creation: We will create a database called "BusReservation" and include collections such as "users", "bookings", "buses" and "routes".

2. Create Users: We will add users to our database by including their information such as name, email, contact number, and a unique ID.

3. Add Buses and Routes: The details of the buses such as their name, capacity and the routes they travel on will be added to the "buses" and "routes" collections respectively.

4. Create Bookings: We will enable users to book their preferred seat in the available bus, and they can pay via a payment gateway. The details of their booking will be stored in the "bookings" collection.

5. Update Bookings: In this step, users will be able to update their reservation by modifying their booking information such as preferred seat number or changing the travel date.

6. Cancel Bookings: Users can cancel their bookings, and the details of their cancellation will be stored in the "bookings" collection.

7. Retrieve Data: The user can retrieve the booking information for a particular bus, check the availability of seats, availability of buses on a particular route, and even the booking history of the user.

8. Analytics: We can use MongoDB's aggregation framework to generate analytics such as the number of bookings, revenue generated, and more.
