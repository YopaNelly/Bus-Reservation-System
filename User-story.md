As a frequent traveler, I want to be able to easily book bus tickets online, so that I can save time and avoid the hassle of waiting in long queues. 

When I visit the bus reservation website, I want to be able to search for available buses on my chosen date and route, and have access to information like departure and arrival times, bus type, seat availability, and fare details.

Once I have selected the bus and seats, I want to be able to make a payment securely and quickly, and receive a confirmation of my booking via email or SMS. 

If I need to make changes to my booking or cancel it, I want to have the option to do so easily and without any additional charges. 

Additionally, I would like to have access to a customer support team that can assist me with any queries or issues I may face during the booking process or during my journey. 

Overall, I want the bus reservation website to provide a hassle-free and user-friendly experience that allows me to easily plan and book my travel.
